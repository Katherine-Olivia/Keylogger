🔹 Keylogger & Mouse Tracker
This is a basic keylogger and mouse activity tracker built using Python, Tkinter, and Pynput. I developed this project a long time ago as a simple way to understand how a keylogger works. Over time, I improved it by adding mouse tracking, timestamps, and a GUI to start/stop logging.

📌 Features
✅ Records keystrokes (pressed & released keys)
✅ Tracks mouse movements, clicks, and scrolls
✅ Saves logs in logs.txt (plain text) & logs.json (structured JSON)
✅ Timestamps every event (keystrokes & mouse activity)
✅ Tkinter GUI to start/stop logging & clear logs
✅ Does NOT close on stop (so logs can be cleared before exiting)

📂 Log File Formats
1️⃣ logs.txt (Plain Text Format) ang logs.json

🛠️ Setup & Usage
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install pynput
2️⃣ Run the Program
python keylogger.py
3️⃣ Use the GUI
🟢 Start Logging → Begins tracking keystrokes & mouse movement

🔴 Stop Logging → Stops logging (but keeps window open)

🧹 Clear Logs → Deletes all stored logs

⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. Do NOT use this tool for any illegal activity. Unauthorized keylogging is illegal and unethical. Always get consent before running a keylogger on any device.

📌 Future Improvements
🔹 Export logs in CSV format 📜

🔹 Developed by Katherine Olivia
A basic project from the past, just for learning purposes! 🚀
